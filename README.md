# appointmentScheduler
Appointment scheduler for study purpose

Basic Idea behind the Project: We know that in companies and big organizations and businesses, there are a lot of appointments on a daily basis. So, it becomes very difficult for the business person or employees of these organizations who are responsible for keeping a record of all the appointments and daily meetings. So, an Appointment Scheduler can be a web-based software application that can help these people in the effective management of their time and keeping records of all the appointments and meetings.

Project Description: This is a web-based project and allows the users to log in to the web page. After logging in, the users can add, edit or even delete the appointment schedules. The feature of SMS sending should be a must in this project to remind the user of an upcoming appointment with its date and time. In order to make this more complete and advanced, authentication while logging in should be added to make it more secure. Some of the key features of this project are

1. Users can Log In and Log Out of the application.
2. Logging in requires a user id and password. The user ID should be a valid email ID and the password is of the userâ€™s choice. There should be authentication and security while Logging In and an option to change passwords should also be provided to the users.
3. Adding new appointments and deleting some of them. Auto-deletion of the appointment after the time has passed can also be an interesting feature.
4. The list of all the upcoming appointments and the feature for searching for an appointment should be there.
5. Sending SMS to the user prior to the appointment time.
